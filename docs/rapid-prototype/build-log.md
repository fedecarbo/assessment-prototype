  - Updates when URL changes via `useEffect` hook
- Provides `selectedTaskId`, `setSelectedTaskId`, `taskGroups` array, and `taskMap` for O(1) lookups

      - Component state: isExpanded tracks whether full response is visible
      - Truncation logic: Word-based (not character-based) for cleaner breaks

  - Neutral: Gray badge
- **Filtering logic:** Real-time filtering based on selected tab (all/support/object/neutral)
- **Empty state:** "No neighbours match this filter" when filtered
- Client-side state management with React hooks (activeTab state)
- More detailed than Application Details page summary
- **Mock data updates:** Realistic neighbour responses with varied lengths, tones, and emotional content
  - Mix of formal and informal language
  - Range from brief (1-2 sentences) to lengthy (multiple paragraphs)
  - Emotional variety: angry objections with capitals/exclamation marks, measured concerns, enthusiastic support
  - Real-world concerns: construction noise, privacy, working from home, young children, property values

### Design Patterns

**Tab Navigation:** (Styled to match Application Details scrollspy navigation)
- Active tab: 3px blue bottom border (`border-primary`), black text (`text-foreground`)
- Inactive tab: transparent border, blue text (`text-primary`), underline on hover
- Font: text-base (matches Application Details)
- Padding: py-3 (matches Application Details)
- Gap: gap-6 between tabs (24px, matches Application Details)
- Border approach: `border-b-[3px]` (matches Application Details)

**Placeholder Style:**
- 400px min-height, dashed border, muted background, rounded corners
- Descriptive text explaining future content purpose

**Design Philosophy:**
- Application Information page: Granular, detailed content for deep dives
- Application Details page: High-level summaries for quick overview
- Both pages should feel consistent in styling and patterns

## Interactive Map Integration (2025-10-20)

**Component:** MapView - Leaflet-based interactive mapping component
**Dependencies:** leaflet, react-leaflet, @types/leaflet

### MapView Component
- **File:** [map-view.tsx](components/shared/map-view.tsx)
- **Framework:** Leaflet with React-Leaflet wrapper
- **Features:**
  - OpenStreetMap tile layer for base map
  - Rectangle overlays for constraint boundaries
  - Color-coded constraints by type (conservation: blue, listed: red, TPO: green, flood: dark blue, etc.)
  - Dynamic visibility based on sidebar checkbox state
  - Default center: Southwark, London (51.5074, -0.0901)
  - Auto-fit bounds with 50px padding
- **Props:** visibleConstraints (Set<string>), constraints (Constraint[])
- **Styling:** Full height/width, rounded corners, responsive
- **Icon fix:** Includes Leaflet default marker icon configuration for Next.js compatibility

### ApplicationInfoConstraints Updates
- **Layout:** Sidebar moved to right (370px fixed width, left border)
- **Map position:** Left side, flex-1, 30px padding all sides
- **Integration:** MapView component replaces placeholder, receives constraint visibility state
- **Height:** Map fills available screen height with overflow-hidden

### ApplicationInfoLayout Updates
- **Constraints tab:** Full-width layout (overflow-hidden) for map integration
- **Other tabs:** 1100px max-width with px-4 py-8 padding (Overview, Documents, Site history, Consultees, Neighbours)
- **Content wrapping:** Each non-constraints tab wrapped in constrained div for consistent spacing

### Mock Constraint Geometries
- Example boundaries for conservation-area, listed-building, TPO, flood-risk
- Latitude/longitude bounds format: [[lat1, lng1], [lat2, lng2]]
- Displayed as semi-transparent rectangles with colored borders
