      briefSummary: 'Most neighbours are against this proposal, with five objections, two in support, and one neutral comment. The main worry is about losing natural light - four people who live nearby say their kitchens and gardens will be darker, especially those at numbers 9 and 13 who share a boundary with the property. People also raised concerns about privacy from the new windows overlooking their gardens, the appearance of the modern materials like bi-fold doors in this Victorian street, construction noise and traffic, and potential damage to the shared access road. The two neighbours who support the application think the design is well thought out and won\'t negatively affect surrounding properties.',
